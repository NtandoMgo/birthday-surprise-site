        Ever since we met, I knew that I wanted to be the reason you smile, <br />
        especially today. <br /><br />
        You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, <br />
        and I hope that this year, this day becomes special for you again. <br /><br />

        Will you be my girlfriend?
